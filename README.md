Featured Arkanoid Game 

Project Arkanoid is a tribute to my first computer which only had DOS and a few simple games that required command line navigation to make them run. It is a 2D breakout game played in a browser and is implemented in JavaScript. The user can navigate the game using their keyboard and/or mouse to direct the ball to hit bricks. The game model tracks users lives, scores, and time to complete a game. It also allows the user to save the game and continue playing later. Project Arkanoid allows users to register to be included by name in the leaderboard, as well as track their individual statistics and use the saved game functionality.

Tech stack: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Jinja, Javascript, JQuery, Ajax, Bootstrap

For game setup run in a shell: vagrant up vagrant ssh $ source setup.sh and visit corresponding local URL for play.

Deployment is in progress.
